Hi! I am Lesmana Adhe Wijaya and i am a 22-Year-old fresh graduate student majoring in International Relations studies in UIN Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta.
Currently, I am developing a skillset related to data analysis in which I have already managed to learn Excel, SQL, and Tableau.

Project name	:	COVID-19 Cases
Source		:	COVID-19 data by Our World in Data (https://catalog.ourworldindata.org/garden/covid/latest/compact/compact.csv)
Excel Source	:	https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xQucvhMOk8HYvmVAi4wIChMxAlGeDyA7?usp=sharing

This is a COVID-19 Cases data exploration project. The data source was downloaded and labeled as 'compact' data by Our World in Data because it contains a complete set
of COVID-19 case reports. The data was then cleaned in Excel into a proper data by removing unwanted columns and replacing non-usable value.
For usability in SQL, the data is divided into two, that is:

- Table1 = Covid_Portfolio.dbo.Covid_Death
- Table2 = Covid_Portfolio.dbo.Covid_Vaccination

Some query results then transfered into Excel to be cleaned before being imported into Tableau (public).
